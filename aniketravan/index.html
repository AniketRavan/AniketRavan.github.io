	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Center for Biophysics and Quantitative Biology](https://biophysics.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.<br> Broadly speaking, my research focuses on problems in quantitative ethology [(preprint)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.06.522821v1?rss=1) and in-vivo protein-protein interactions, with a recurring theme of probing biophysical systems in their native environment. I'm particularly interested in technique development, both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, borrowing techniques from physics, biochemistry and machine learning. </p>
