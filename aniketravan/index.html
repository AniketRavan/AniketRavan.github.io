	<p style="margin:0";align="justify"></b>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href = "https://biophysics.illinois.edu">Center for Biophysics and Quantitative Biology</a> at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.<br>Broadly speaking, my research focuses on problems in quantitative ethology <a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.06.522821v1?rss=1">(preprint)</a> and in-vivo protein-protein interactions,<br> with a recurring theme of probing biophysical systems in their native environment. I'm particularly interested in technique development,<br> both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, borrowing techniques from physics, biochemistry and machine learning. </p>
